# FileSystems
Project 4 1550


Using fuse to write the getattr, readdir, mkdir, mknode, write, and read methods of a file system. 

Everything works except trying to write to a file using echo and redirection or nano when only one file exists. If two or more file exists then everything is fine. 

File system is set up in a 2-level system. Root can only contain directories and those directories can only contain files.
